  <h1>How Boston’s Vietnamese students are reclaiming their identities in school</h1>

 <p><span class="dropcap">T</span> he words typed out onto the page in front of Helen Vo had always made sense to her when they were spoken aloud — so why didn’t they make sense when printed in ink?</p>

 <p>Just 30 minutes before, she had been sitting with her friends in class, going over multiplication and division — the typical 5th-grade course materials. But when the time for English came, her teacher quickly whisked her out of the classroom. As she walked into the hallway and meekly waved goodbye to her friends, she felt their eyes follow her out of the door</p>

 <p>This sudden removal from class was a regular occurrence for Vo during elementary school. She vividly recalls sitting in on parent-teacher conferences, nervously shifting in her seat as her teachers told her parents that they needed to stop speaking Vietnamese at home so Vo wouldn’t get “confused” in class.<a href="https://codepen.io/andyhullinger/pen/MovOqz" target="new"></a></p>
<P> Because of her teachers’ qualms about her understanding of English, Vo was often separately tested on her reading and writing comprehension — tested on lessons that were three or four years below her grade level. Each time she was tested, Vo felt more and more unsure of her place among her peers. If she was continually being tested on simple vocabulary words and spelling when the rest of her class was in the middle of reading chapter books, what did that say about her belonging? </P>
 <P> Growing up in Worcester, Massachusetts should have been full of opportunities for Vo to immerse herself in Vietnamese culture, but these ritual English lessons inhibited her from interacting with her family and friends, as she forgot how to speak Vietnamese entirely. She suddenly could not understand or communicate with those she loved. In losing that crucial language piece, she lost part of her identity.

<P>“It was a waste of my time at that point, having to get tested for so long,” Vo asserts. “Why would I not understand? I understand this language so fluently that I forgot my native one.”</p>
<p> Vo’s experience in school is shared by many students of Vietnamese descent who receive an education in the United States. Some educators see them and immediately attempt to mold them into the “perfect American student.” However, these efforts typically end up with Vietnamese students feeling disconnected. They feel a debilitating effect on their sense of self, as they have nothing to grasp onto that makes them ‘Vietnamese.’ Their emotional states suffer under these feelings, and affect their ability to do well in school.</p>
<p> After analyzing U.S. Census data from 2019, the Pew Research Center found that just 37% of U.S.-born Vietnamese people have a bachelor’s degree, compared to 19% of foreign-born Vietnamese people living in America. These statistics illustrate a clear issue in retention at schools — specifically within upper level institutions.</p>

<p> These low percentages often fly under the radar, as Vietnamese statistics are grouped alongside numbers belonging to other Asian populations in America, who have been boxed into a “model minority” stereotype. Josephine Kim, a Senior Lecturer of Education at Harvard University, recognizes that the pervasiveness of this stereotype “is going to obscure the refugee experience. It’s going to obscure all of that trauma. It’s going to say, ‘I’m not reaching out to give you help, because you’re supposed to be fine.’”</p>
<p> Throughout her time as a professor, Kim has recognized this deficit when it comes to Vietnamese retention rates in upper level institutions, and contextualizes the struggle with the lived history of Vietnamese refugees.</p>
<p> Kim asserts, “(Vietnamese refugees come) into the most racialized nation on Earth. As soon as they get here, from the general population’s limited understanding of Asians and Asian Americans, they will be placed in a very racial narrative that they probably don’t understand or have never heard of … they’ll be placed there, and treated as if they belong to it. Even if they’ve been here for a long time, they’ll still be treated as if they’re very foreign.”</p>
<p> Vietnamese refugees began arriving in the United States of America in the aftermath of the Vietnam War, initially under a federal refugee policy which placed them in areas where there were few other immigrants. Though, in the 1980s, these laws changed, and the government was able to justify clustering refugees in certain neighborhoods.
  Many refugees and their families relocated to major cities — in Massachusetts specifically, they settled in Boston and the surrounding cities; Lowell, Lawrence, Quincy, Randolph, Worcester, and Springfield. Vietnamese communities are currently most highly concentrated in Boston’s neighborhood of Dorchester in the Fields Corner district. As of 2020, the Vietnamese population in the state was around 50,459 people, and was projected to continue growing.</p>

<p> While the lives of Vietnamese refugees and their families might have changed in Boston during the past four decades, the sunset has stayed the same.
  Just before the sun creeps below the horizon, a camera’s shutter quickly clicks — snap — Thi Hoang’s lens captures Boston’s iconic skyscrapers standing stoic, silhouetted by the sky’s brilliant hues of fuschia, pink and speckles of golden sunlight peeking out of the clouds.</p>
<h2> “In Vietnam, we don’t have that kind of sunset,” Hoang asserts.
  While Hoang and her family immigrated to the United States around July of 2016 when she was 19, the novelty of Boston’s sunsets has not worn off.</h2>

<p> Hoang, her parents and 2 sisters moved to Boston so that she could enroll in college. Her aunt encouraged her to apply to the University of Massachusetts Boston (UMass Boston), and assisted her through hours of filling out required documents and wordy applications. Now, Hoang is in the final stretch of her senior year.</p>
<p> “I didn’t expect much (when coming to America),” she asserts. “But it was definitely a shock for me. Everything is completely different, whether it’s language or the people — even the culture is different.”</p>
<p> Hoang had zero understanding of English when she first arrived in Boston. She spent the first couple of years listening and observing, trying to wrap her head around English lingo and the semantics of the language. On top of the language barrier, adapting to the vastly different culture within America gave — and continues to give — her massive headaches.</p>

  </p>
<p> This fight for students like Hoang to remain enrolled in school is not a recent development. Vietnamese people have been an invisible educational statistic since the first wave of refugees immigrated to the United States in the late 1970s.</p>
<p> With Saigon left in a state of disarray after the Vietnam War effort ended in failure for the South Vietnamese and American troops, many Vietnamese fled, seeking better lives for themselves and their families in other countries. No matter where they were to go, it would be much better than living in post-war Vietnam.</p>
<p> The everyday lives of Vietnamese refugees in America were riddled with hardships, as they attempted to assimilate into a foreign culture and society. Their physical appearances, lack of English proficiency and traumatic emotional experiences stopped them from being fully welcomed; effectively teaching them that they did not belong in a nation that was supposed to accept everyone.</p>
<p> Even after enrolling in college, many Vietnamese students experience confusing feelings related to their identities that they often suppress, as no one around them has the cultural awareness needed to understand their specific experiences. On top of those barriers, American college cultures can be extremely unwelcoming to international students in general, and at times, Vietnamese students feel forced to assimilate to American culture, forgoing their Vietnamese heritage for one widely accepted by others.
  With this pressure bearing down on Vietnamese students, they sometimes end up crumbling without receiving the proper support in their educational endeavors.</p>

<p> The loss of her Vietnamese fluency took a toll on her sense of self, and she spent the remainder of her days before college feeling as though she didn’t fully belong within the Vietnamese community.</p>
<p> Now, Vo is spending a semester in Vietnam, relearning Vietnamese and reclaiming a part of her identity that had been stripped away by the American school systems. Though, she would not have had the courage to do so were it not for a class at UMass Boston, called Resources for Vietnamese American Studies.</p>
<p> Prior to taking Resources for Vietnamese American Studies, Vo had enrolled in a singular Asian American Studies class and had her entire world shaken. There were so many underlying layers of what it meant to be Vietnamese American, and these discoveries made her question her understanding of herself.</p>
<p> Though, after taking that one course, Vo felt as though her work was done.
  “I was dedicated to graduating and never having to take another Asian American Studies class,” Vo shares. “But I would keep looking at the catalog every semester, wanting to see what course was there just for me. I would see some that looked interesting, but didn’t really stand out to me or connect with how unsure I felt.”</p>
<p> That was, until she had to fulfill a last-minute course requirement. She took a look at the course catalog again, eyes glazing after skimming over endless course descriptions. Resources for Vietnamese American Studies caught her eye and Vo knew she had to be in it.</p>

<p> In the course, students are advised by PhD candidate Linh-Phương Vũ, a practicing mental health counselor by trade, and a Vietnamese refugee herself.</p>
<p> Students work to conceptualize historical concepts about Vietnam and Vietnamese populations in America. Vũ encourages students to have the autonomy to build their own identity in America connected to their Vietnamese roots. Having a safe space to delve into the context that informs their understanding of their identities has been integral in making these students feel validated and seen for who they are.</p>
<p> The class was not offered at UMass Boston for six years prior to Vũ teaching it, so students actively make the decision to enroll; knowing that it is not a core class or even an elective that will work toward completing their major.</p>
<h2> “It’s hard work mentally and emotionally. These students seek it out, but don’t know what they’re seeking out. In working with my students that way, they’re coming to school with much more of a drive and motivation." </h2>
<p> “It’s hard work mentally and emotionally. These students seek it out, but don’t know what they’re seeking out,” Vũ observes. “In working with my students that way, they’re coming to school with much more of a drive and motivation. They’re forming communities with other students who are going through the same thing.”</p>
<p> With Vũ’s lived experience of being a refugee on top of her specific knowledge of Vietnamese culture, she meets the students on a familiar playing field. The students have someone to look up to who has worked through similar feelings; validating all of their experiences.</p>
<p> “With Linh, I could be open about my struggles as a Vietnamese American,” Vo shares. “She changed my life. I don’t even know if she knows that. It’s like having this family that you were looking for this entire time.”</p>
<p> In a course evaluation survey Vũ gave her students, an anonymous student answered in a way that encapsulated the change that needs to occur, writing, “We need to ensure that there is Vietnamese representation in our courses, especially in ethnic studies. We need our faculty to look like us, to understand what we went through, and what our parents went through. We need to hire a faculty member with a specialized expertise in Vietnamese American studies; that choice will benefit not only us Vietnamese American students, but also enrich the educational experience for all students, fostering a more diverse and inclusive learning environment.”</p>

<p> Representation in schools is of the utmost importance. Students need to know that there are people who look like them and who feel the same way as them out there somewhere. After all, if they know that others have done it, then they realize that they can as well.</p>
<h2> “Self efficacy comes from vicarious learning — seeing somebody who looks like me, who has the same background, a similar shared experience, who’s able to do something.” </h2> 
<p> These role models are “not elevated in such a way that everybody can be exposed to and have access to.”</p>
<p> Having resources specifically made for Vietnamese students’ minds is integral when it comes to validating their experiences and making them feel as though they belong. And while some resources are optional, history courses are not.</p>
<p> Courses like Resources for Vietnamese American Studies should not be optional electives, but instead opportunities for students to earn full credit. History classes should not merely; skimming over the Vietnam War and end students’ exploration of Asian identities there. Asian students should be fully represented in the curricula that they are paying money for. Along with these types of courses, institutions get appointed faculty, dedicated staff support, intentional library resources, and also dedicated spaces for these students to feel fully supported.</p>
<p> “We’re giving them information, and we’re connecting them to the community; connecting them back to their roots. Re-rooting, reclaiming, re-identifying, unlearning a lot of things, and re-learning a lot of things,” Vũ affirms.
</p>
<p> These are just a few recommendations for action that could be put in place to better serve the Vietnamese communities. There is much work to be done, but rest assured, there are plenty of people willing to lend a hand to the cause.
</p>
<p> “We’re just starting this; we’re at the beginning of the duration,” Vo asserts, a smile spreading across her face. “We are a whole generation of second gens coming in. Generation after generation, it’s going to start with thinking about how we can add this cultural inclusivity into these curricula. It’s starting with us right now. I’m really hoping the future generations will be able to have not just what we have, but something more.”
